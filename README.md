# Password-Generator-HW3

## Description:

I create a password generator using Html, CSS and Javascript. This generator generates the password that includes upper cases, lower cases, numbers and symbols randomly with a minimum length of 8 and maximum length of 128. I used the Charcodes that provides these variables randomly. User can click or unclick any of these variables when they create the password thanks to click EventListener. When user wants to create a password they just decide the length of password, what characters build the password and click them and click the password Generator button and password will appears on the screen of input area.
